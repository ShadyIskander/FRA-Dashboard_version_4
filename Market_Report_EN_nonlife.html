            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The objective of this report is to provide a comprehensive view on the insurance market in Egypt to assist the readers make an informed decision regarding their investment and/or operation in The Egyptian Insurance market. 
                The Financial Regulatory Authority (FRA) issues an annual report which is very rich in data but does not provide sufficient indicators of the market and limited comparability.
                </p>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h2>Target Readers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Executive management of Insurance companies</li>
                <li>Investment bankers who may have an opportunity for their clients</li>
                <li>Asset Managers seeking to understand the insurance market</li>
                <li>Independent Board Directors of insurance companies</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h2>Caveats</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data granularity: In some cases, the data are not granular enough to provide useful analytics. In these cases, we tend to use assumptions  (e.g. elimination of inadmissible assets in solvency calculation) .</li>
                <li>Data integrity: In some cases, we noticed that the figures change from one year to another (A closing of one period is different than the opening of the following period)</li>
                <li>Imbalance between Life and Non-Life insurance: While there is abundant data on the Non-Life lines of business, the amount of data available for the Life insurance branch is relatively smaller</li>
                <li>Inconsistency of presentation: Very apparent in the medical insurance sector which is offered by both Life and Non-Life companies. The revenues and expenses of the same line differ between Life and Non-Life companies. </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h2>Market Evolution in 5 Years</h2>
            <h3>COVID</h3>
            <p>Although it is considered history, COVID had a significant influence on the market. From one side, it increased the cost of claims for insurance companies in Egypt but on the other side, it also increased the awareness of the importance of medical insurance.</p>

            <h3>Post-COVID</h3>
            <p>After the end of the COVID era, there was a surge in the business due to the resumption of trade and all commercial activities. </p>

            <h3>Devaluation</h3>
            <p>During 2022-2024, Egypt has seen two major devaluation waves taking the foreign exchange from 15.7 EGP /USD to 48 EGP/USD i.e. 300% increase. This has caused several impacts on the Insurance market. On one side, it increased the cost of operation for the insurance companies but, in the meantime, it increased the premiums, especially on the Non-Life side as the insured assets were revalued according to the new exchange rates.</p>

            <h3>Geopolitical Situation</h3>
            <p>During 2024, The region has seen a severe tension related to the war in neighbouring countries and its impact on the Suez Canal traffic, which led to stress on the Egyptian economy and increase in risk factors in the whole region. </p>

            <h3>New Insurance Law</h3>
            <p>One of the main impactful events was the overdue launch of the new Insurance Law which brought several enhancements from the old law, among which the introduction of several new coverages and allowance specialty insurance such as medical and micro insurance. </p>

            <div class="section-divider"></div>

            <h2>Current Market</h2>
            <h3>Penetration</h3>
            <p>Penetration rate is insignificant for a country like Egypt. This can be seen as a weakness and opportunity at the same time. While in some other developing countries it hovers around 3%, in Egypt, it still remains at c. 0.7% </p>

            <h3>Regulations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The insurance market is regulated by the Financial Regulatory Authority which regulates all Non-Banking Financial Institutions. Insurance is the oldest activity under regulations. </li>
                <li>The regulator still uses Solvency 1 (compliance based) rather than risk-based approach.</li>
                <li>In 2023, the FRA dictated that all companies should start implementing EAS 50 which is the Egyptian version of IFRS 17.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Main Players</h3>
            <p>The market has 40+ companies. A clear dominance is manifested by Misr Insurance (both Life and Non-life), the state owned companies (currently owned by the Egyptian Sovereign Fund) and several international companies among which Allianz, AXA , MetLife and GIG.</p>

            <h3>Dominant Lines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Life: Group Life and credit life, as they are “pull” products requested by corporate customers, as well as Medical Insurance for the same reason above.</li>
                <li>Non-Life: Medical, Motor (Complementary) and property totalling (x%) of the total GWP</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Digitization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Companies side: Several players started digitalization of their processes to achieve more efficiency and to combat any fraud in claims, especially medical. Some have also launched mobile applications to help the customers reach their services in a digital manner. </li>
                <li>Regulator’s sides: We have seen initiatives from the regulator focusing on cybersecurity as well as linking the companies’ data base to the regulator’s data depository to enhance the control on the market.</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lack of Public Awareness: Many Egyptians still perceive insurance as unnecessary, complex and religiously controversial.</li>
                        <li>Weak Distribution Channels: Traditional distribution models dominate, with limited digital adoption outside major cities.</li>

                        <li>Low Insurance Penetration: This can be seen as an opportunity and a weakness in the same time but we believe that the low penetration rate is a very good opportunity as it permits the market to growth serval folds before reaching saturation level, provided offering innovative products and enforcing more compulsory coverage.</li>
                        <li>Digital Transformation: The rise of Insurtech and mobile-based solutions can improve accessibility and efficiency especially with the young customers who are the majority of the market in the coming teen years.</li>
                        <li>Expected growth of the economy especially in construction, triggered by mega projects like Ras El Hekma and the like. In addition to the business lines that will follow the construction. This guarantees an increase in the market -at least-  for the coming decade </li>

                        <li>Expansion into SMEs and Microinsurance: Targeting small businesses and lower-income individuals can help expand coverage especially that the new law allowed the establishment of SME special; companies who can offer both Life and Non-Life packages.</li>
